# Overview

For this project, we created a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Chain from a provided "pre-set" code. We also reverse engineered it to work with our hand-created code, after cloning the provided templates.

Using GitHub Actions with a makefile, requirements, and python code, we performed an initial lint, test, and install cycle to verify deployment and functionality. 

After finalizing the above step, we integrated the Github actions with Azure DevOps Pipelines, replacing the initial code with a pre-created sklearn code that will predict housing prices in Boston.
